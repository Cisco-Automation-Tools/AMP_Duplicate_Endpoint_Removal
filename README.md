# AMP_Duplicate_Endpoint_Removal


## Introduction
 
You've successfully deployed AMP for Endpoints and it is now running on your system.  Great!  You may find that a duplicate endpoint is appearing in your AMP database.  This tool can be used as a workaround to remove that duplicate.

## Disclaimer

This is not an officially supported tool and was developed as a side project, not as an official release by Cisco.  Any support received will be on an as-available timeframe and feature requests may not be fulfilled.

## Installation
 
No installation is required.  The tool can be downloaded or cloned from GitHub.  If you'd like to make an EXE, you can do so with [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/):
> pyinstaller --onefile --console --icon amp-icon.ico .\amp_dup_removal.py

Current executable has been included in the files above for ease of use.

## Usage
 
To start the tool, ensure that you have an instance of AMP running and run the main_page.py script. If you have an executable from PyInstaller, just right-click the executable and select "Run as Administrator".  You'll be presented with the GUI interface.
